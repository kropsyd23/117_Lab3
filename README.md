# Group Lab 3

Write a Python script that reads the following CSV file containing information on countries (country_full.csv Download country_full.csv) and splits the countries by region generating one file per region. For example: Europe.CSV should have only European countries.
Keep the country names and region in the output files.
The CSV file format is explained in the textbook section 14.3
Incorporate exception handling (try/except) as there are many errors that may occur when trying to access files, such as IOError, FileNotFoundError, PermissionError
